Problem: Making sure that all contents fit the width of the page wihtout any white space or any open space.

Solution: Made sure that header, html and body width were set to 100% because that adjusts your content to contain the scroll bar as well, leaving no space. Also, set overflow-x to hidden so the horizontal bar only appears if needed.
