Felipe: worked on filtering system, working on some backend and has a version of displaying it
Sophia: kept working on matching system, set up backend query for it, just need to get preferences from logged in user
Possible format of displaying search/matching results: display name, age, and gender
Ghea: fixed CSS from quiz, fixed roommate survey CSS so everything is aligned, adding part in survey for picture as an image link
Plans to test PHP as we go along, make our own smaller test databases
