The meeting discussed scheduling an appointment, resolving conflicts, validating pages, updating GitHub, working on search function and surveys, deciding housing filter categories, and ensuring styled and validated pages.

Need to schedule an appointment with Dr. Callihan for Sunday at 8 PM.
Conflicts in Sophia's branch need to be resolved, plan to discuss with her.
Validate pages and consider adding styling, focus on backend functionality first.
The team needs to update the GitHub set and work on the search function and surveys.
They are considering what categories to include in the housing filter.
Each member needs to ensure their pages are styled and validated, but nothing too elaborate.
